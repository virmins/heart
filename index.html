            <h2>Dear SECRET SA,</h2>
            <p>
                For two years, I’ve been just a name on your screen, just a friend in the background of your world. But in my heart, you have been so much more. I never meant to fall for you, yet somewhere between our conversations, your laughter, and the way you simply exist, I did. I’ve held these feelings back, afraid of what they might mean to you, afraid of losing even the smallest place I have in your life. But I can’t pretend anymore—I like you, truly and deeply. I don’t know if you could ever see me as more than a friend, but I had to take this chance, to finally be honest with you.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Always,<br>Kikoy</strong></p>
